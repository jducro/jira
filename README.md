## Installation
    
This project requires [Deskpro Apps Tool](https://github.com/deskpro/deskproapps-dpat) to be installed alongside the other dependencies. You can install [Deskpro Apps Tool](https://github.com/deskpro/deskproapps-dpat) either locally or globally. We recommend to install it globally so you have it always availabe
    
To install the dependencies and [Deskpro Apps Tool](https://github.com/deskpro/deskproapps-dpat) locally, run:
    
    npm install && npm install @deskproapps/dpat@^0.7   

If you already have [Deskpro Apps Tool](https://github.com/deskpro/deskproapps-dpat) installed, run:
 
    npm install

## Development
             
In your project folder run    
    
    npm run dev
 
Go to your deskpro installation, login to the agent interface, and navigate to the link below: 
    
    https://your-local-deskpro.com/agent/?appstore.environment=development

Notice the **appstore.environment=development** query parameter that tells Deskpro to load your application from the development server

### Changing the default application
 
To start making changes, open the following file in  your favourite editor.
 
    src/main/javascript/App.jsx
    
While the development server is on,  any change will cause the application to be reloaded in the Deskpro window, giving 
you a nice live preview.

## Packaging

Once you are satisfied with your application, you will probably want to install it on your production or test installation of [DeskPRO](https://www.deskpro.com).
To do that, you must package your application files in a distribution package that can be understood by [DeskPRO](https://www.deskpro.com) when it will install your application,

To package the application, in your project folder run:    
    
    npm run package

This will create a `dist` folder inside your project folder which contains all the unpacked and compiled assets
and a zip file named `app.zip`. This `app.zip` file is the one required to install your application via the DeskPro admin interface.
